## Methodology
---

-	We created a database of amenities for each social infrastructure.

- For this study we defined *coverage* as being less than *30 minutes* by private transport from at least one social service infrastructure. 

-	We used the Mapbox API to calculate distance measurements to each georeference using the desired profile and time. 

- We used the High Resolution Population Density Map to obtain a location layer of the population of interest in order to perform the coverage analysis.

- The population outside the proximity polygons were identified. 

-	Outcome metrics were created at the national level and state level to identify the population without coverage.
